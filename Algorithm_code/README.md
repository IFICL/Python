# Algorithms implemented in Python
_____________________________________
The algorithms are mostly learnt from UM-SJTU VG441: Supply Chain Management

## Graph.py
It implements my own graph data structure and it will be used in the following algorithms.

## Dijkstras.py
It is an algorithm about the short path problem, and needs to import Graph.py

## ForkFulkerson.py
It is an algorithm about Maximum flow problem and it use BFS to find the augmenting path, so in fact, it should be named as Edmonds-Karp algorithm
It needs to import Graph.py

## PushRelabel.py
It is an another algorithm about the Maximum flow problem with O(n) time complexity.
It needs to import Graph.py
